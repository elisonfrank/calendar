### Calendar

The goal is to display a calendar with all days of the month.

In addition, the application contains a list of notes and holidays on the days.

This project was made to test react and css code. Must be responsive and look good.

It needs to use my API [click here](https://github.com/elisonfrank/calendar-api) developed in Nodejs.
